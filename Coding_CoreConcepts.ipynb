    "### Markdown Cells\n",
    "A Jupyter Notebook contains **cells** with formatted text using **Markdown** language. *Markdown* cells like this one, allows you to document your program with visual capabilities beyond what the typical in-line documentation offers.\n",

    "Check out the following link for guidance on Markdown cells for Jupyter Notebooks:\n",

    "\n",
    "### Code Cells\n",
    "A cell with code will mainly contain the commands or instructions you want the computer to execute. For example, the line below tells the computer to write out the phrase \"Hello World\": \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print \"Hello World\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "You can (**AND SHOULD**) also include **in-line comments** as part of your code to document what your set of instructions is doing. Every language has its own way in which it interprets text as a *comment*. For Python, a comment line starts with the # character.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# This is a comment line.\n",
    "```\n",
